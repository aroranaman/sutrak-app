## Core Features:

- 360° Body Scan: Capture user's body measurements via a 360° scan using the mobile camera and IMU data, ensuring no raw images are stored for privacy.
- AI-Powered Measurement Extraction: Use computer vision and deep learning (SMPL-X, PIFuHD) to construct a 3D body model from the scan and extract accurate tailoring measurements (bust, waist, hip, inseam). A tool identifies when retry prompts are appropriate for users.
- Virtual Try-On: Enable users to virtually try on garments by retargeting 3D garment templates onto their body model and simulating cloth drape using position-based dynamics.
- Photo-Realistic Rendering: Enhance the realism of the try-on experience using diffusion models to add micro-details and realistic textures to the rendered garment.
- Brand Integration: Allow brands to upload 3D garment models and fabric textures to enable virtual try-on for their products.
- Gamified Credit System: Incentivize user engagement with a credit-based system for body scans and purchases, including bonus credits for larger orders.
- Data Storage: Store user data safely and securely using PostgreSQL and AWS S3 encrypted at rest. Manage user sessions with Redis.
